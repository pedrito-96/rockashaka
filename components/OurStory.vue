    Rocka Shaka Tee Company originated in the summer of 2022 in Lakeland, Florida, when a group of Florida Southern College students set out to assist sororities, fraternities, clubs, organizations, and local sports teams of all sizes. Starting with their own designs, they transformed them into wearable artwork using Heat Transfer Vinyl and screen printing techniques.</p>

    Through experimentation and refinement, they mastered the art of transferring personal designs onto various types of apparel, including t-shirts, polos, and more. Upon learning that fellow college students were struggling to order custom shirts for their organizations' annual Fall events, they swiftly took action to provide an affordable solution.</p>
